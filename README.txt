---Controls---
The game uses WASD movement, with some other controls
during menu screens. These will be displayed to the
user as they come.


---Cheat Codes---
There are no cheat codes for this game. Both levels
are available from the main menu, so a level skip
system is uneccessary. Having a way to display the
path of the Guards while they are using Dijkstra's
algorithm would have been nice, but it was beyond
the scope of my low-bar goals.


---Low Bar Goals---
Smooth Movement
Functioning loot pickups
Guard Movement (Patrol then Chase)
Revealing the Player
Losing the Game
Functioning Walls

Of these, all except for Revealing the Player were
fully completed. Revealing the Player was split into
two parts, one being when a Guard sees the player and
the other being when the player picks up the special
loot pickup (the gem). The guards were supposed to 
shine a flashlight that would be their method of
detection, but this proved to be a major sticking point
and was changed to if the player is in an adjacent tile
to a guard. The loot pickup reveal works as intended.

---Other Goals---
The only non low-bar goal that was completed was to have
menu screens in the game, although this is more of an
element of polish than a game goal. The splash screens 
are just simple text with an image, but are functional
nonetheless.
